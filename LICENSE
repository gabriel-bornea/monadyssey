Inspiration Acknowledgment:

The `monadyssey` library's development and design approaches draw conceptual inspiration from the Haskell language,
the Arrow library for Kotlin, and the Cats library for Scala. This acknowledgment is to highlight the influence
these projects have had on `monadyssey`'s API design and embrace of functional programming paradigms. It is crucial
to note that this inspiration pertains solely to API design and architecture principles; no direct code from these
projects has been used in `monadyssey`. This library stands as an independent work, and this section is included to
honor the spirit of shared knowledge and to contribute to community growth within the functional programming ecosystem.
